Genres: Bullethell, Turn-based.

JRPG-esque GUI and party commands (attack, item, magic)

During a battle, the boss will spawn tons of bullets that can damage the player. The player must avoid the bullets while also dealing damage to the boss.
The player will have a small menu of commands they can issue to their party (Attack, Item, Magic).
While selecting a command, the bullets (and player movement) will be paused.
Once a command is issued, the player has a limited amount of time to complete a small objective to successfully execute the command.
After the objective is completed, or if time runs out, a new command can be issued.
Attack and Item commands have small rewards for completing all objectives.

Attack:
	Spawns several crosshairs on the field. If the player touches them, the boss will be damaged.
	Last crosshair does extra damage (reward for completing objective)
	(Maybe make crosshairs move to increase difficulty)

Item: (1 turn cooldown, i.e. every other))
	Spawns a random set of items on the field.
	Potion:
		Spawns potion bottles on the field. The player can hover over a potion to heal over time. Leaving the potion will stop healing.
		Last potion heals instantly (reward for completing objective)
	Bomb:
		Spawns a few bombs on the field. Touch to clear bullets in a small radius around the bomb.
		Last bomb clears a larger radius of bullets (reward for completing objective)

Magic: (2 turn cooldown)
	Spawns several pentagram points that must be touched in the correct order. If successful, a random spell will be cast.
	Completing a spell should play a special animation and keep the game "paused" until it completes.
	Slow:
		Slows bullets and volley intervals for a few rounds
	Fireball:
		Large burst damage to the boss
		(Higher damage than Attack, but also higher risk, since messing up will mean NO damage is dealt.)
	Heal:
		Generous healing for player.
		(Better healing than Potion, but high risk)
