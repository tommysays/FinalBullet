Genres: Bullethell, Turn-based.

JRPG-esque GUI and party commands (attack, item, magic)

During a battle, the boss will spawn tons of bullets that can damage the player. The player must avoid the bullets while also dealing damage to the boss.
The player will have a small menu of commands they can issue to their party (Attack, Item, Magic).
Once a command is issued, the player has a limited amount of time to complete a small objective to successfully execute the command.
After the objective is completed, or if time runs out, a new command can be issued.

Attack:
	Spawns several crosshairs on the field. If the player touches them, the boss will be damaged. (Maybe make crosshairs move?)

Item: (1 turn cooldown, i.e. every other))
	Spawns a random set of items on the field.
	Potion:
		Spawns potion bottles on the field. The player can hover over a potion to heal over time. Leaving the potion will stop healing.
	Bomb:
		Spawns several bombs on the field. Same mechanic as Attack crosshairs, but less damage.
		(This is a "trap" in that players fishing for potions may draw this item instead.)

Magic: (2 turn cooldown)
	Spawns several points that must be touched in the correct order. If successful, a random spell will be cast.
	Slow:
		Slows bullets and volley intervals for a few rounds
	Fireball:
		Large burst damage to the boss
		(Higher damage than Attack, but also higher risk, since messing up will mean NO damage is dealt.)
	Heal:
		Generous healing for player.
		(Better healing than Potion, but high risk)
